# Generic-LED-Strip-Controller
Controls many generic LED strips which are sold online on sites such as eBay and Amazon.  Most of these LED strips use the same IR controller that accepts NEC-encoded IR signals from an included remote.  The NEC codes corresponding to the buttons in the GUI sketch are stored and transmitted by the arduino running the Sender sketch.
